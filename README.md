**I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the following projects for providing valuable ideas and technical references:**

- **freecam**: For the camera implementation ideas that lay the foundation for the project's camera control functions.

- **ExplorersCompass**: For the inspiration and reference on listener design, which helps optimize the project's target positioning and event-triggered logic.

- **Travelers-Titles**: For the valuable ideas on listener implementation, which contributes to the improvement of the project's event monitoring system.

## Version Information

Current version: **0.2.0 (In Development)**
The project is currently in active development. Core features are being continuously iterated, optimized, and expanded with the planned functionalities below.

## Future Plans

To further improve the project and enhance the Minecraft animation production experience, the following features are planned for future implementation, building on the project's existing foundation:

- **Path Visualization Effect**: Implement particle-based path visualization using Minecraft's vanilla particles (native game resources), which can intuitively display camera movement trajectories. Different path types will be distinguished by unique particle effects, with highlighted start/end points and optimized particle density to ensure performance while maintaining clarity.

- **Script Timeline System**: Develop a visualized timeline interface for camera paths, based on Minecraft's vanilla game ticks to enable precise control. This system will support real-time progress adjustment, parameter linkage with camera movement, intuitive editing of path duration and sequence, and serve as the basis for subsequent synchronization functions.

- **Timeline-Based Development Interface**: Provide a dedicated development interface built on the timeline system, facilitating seamless synchronization with other in-game behaviors (e.g., character animations from other mods, background music playback, and other custom in-game events).

- **Optimized Script Editing Structure**: Refine the script structure to improve compatibility, readability, and extensibility. The enhanced structure will support more flexible configuration of camera parameters, event triggering rules, and target positioning, while enabling easier import, export, and sharing of scripts.
